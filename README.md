# radio_button

A sample radio button app.

## Getting Started

This is a skeleton structure for your next big app with simple home UI as possible.

You can attach another page routes in the onPressed method of the buttons and
also add more buttons that can be used accordingly.

Change the assets image in the assets folder.

Currently this app is a starting point to a wonderful railway info app.
